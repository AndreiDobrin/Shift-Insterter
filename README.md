# Shift-Inserter

I get my shifts once a month, for the entire next month. This means that every month I have to sit there and manually make an entry in my Google Calendar for every day that I'm working. This very quickly became tedious, so I looked for a way to at least partially automate this process.

As a result of my search, I made this python program that inserts the shifts that I'm going to be working in a month directly into my Google Calendar.
